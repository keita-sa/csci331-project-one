# csci331-project-one

・Project objective (Operating Systems)

Compare the performance of process creation and destruction when implemented with and without linked lists.



✅　The linked list implementation should be slower not faster. 

✅　Linked list is more likely to result in slower because of dynamic memory management.

  （The main reason for the list-free implementation was to improve time-efficiency by avoiding the dynamic memory management needed for the linked lists.）
